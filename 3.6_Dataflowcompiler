1. Verify Permissions on /workspace/DMC
Check the permissions of the /workspace/DMC directory:

bash
Copy code
ls -ld /workspace/DMC
If the directory isnâ€™t writable, proceed to fix the permissions.

2. Update Permissions
To make /workspace/DMC writable, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
sudo chmod -R 777 /workspace/DMC
This grants full read, write, and execute permissions to all users for the directory.

3. Download the Model Again
Retry downloading the model after fixing permissions:

bash
Copy code
wget -O /workspace/DMC/yolov5s.pt https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases/download/v6.0/yolov5s.pt

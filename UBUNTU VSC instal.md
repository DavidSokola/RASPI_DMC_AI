To install Visual Studio Code on Ubuntu, follow these steps:
Method 1: Install via the Official Microsoft Repository (Recommended)

    Open Terminal (you can press Ctrl + Alt + T).

    Update Package Index: Run the following command to ensure your package index is up-to-date:

sudo apt update

Install Prerequisites: Install the required dependencies:

sudo apt install software-properties-common apt-transport-https

Add the Microsoft GPG Key: This step ensures that the packages you're installing are verified.

wget -qO- https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | sudo apt-key add -

Add Visual Studio Code Repository: Add the Visual Studio Code repository to your system's sources list:

sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/vscode stable main"

Update Package Index Again: After adding the repository, update the package list once more:

sudo apt update

Install Visual Studio Code: Finally, install Visual Studio Code:

sudo apt install code

Launch Visual Studio Code: You can now launch VS Code by typing:

    code

Method 2: Install via Snap (Alternative Method)

Ubuntu supports Snap packages, and Visual Studio Code is available through Snap. If you prefer using Snap, follow these steps:

    Install Snap (if not installed): First, make sure Snap is installed on your system:

sudo apt install snapd

Install Visual Studio Code via Snap: Run the following command to install Visual Studio Code:

sudo snap install --classic code

Launch Visual Studio Code: Once installed, you can start it by typing:

    code

Method 3: Install via .deb Package (Manual Method)

    Download the .deb package: Go to the official Visual Studio Code download page and download the .deb package.

    Install the package: Once the package is downloaded, navigate to the directory where it was downloaded and install it using dpkg:

sudo dpkg -i code_*_amd64.deb

Fix any missing dependencies: If you encounter any dependency issues, fix them using:

sudo apt --fix-broken install

Launch Visual Studio Code: Start Visual Studio Code with:

    code

Any of these methods will install Visual Studio Code on your Ubuntu system. The first method is the most common and recommended for updates and security patches, but Snap is a simpler alternative if you prefer a single command installation.

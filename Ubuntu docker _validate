To activate and start Docker on your system, follow these steps:

1. Start Docker Service
If Docker is not already running, you can start the Docker service using systemctl:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl start docker
This command will start the Docker service.

2. Enable Docker to Start on Boot
If you want Docker to automatically start when your system boots, run:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl enable docker
This ensures that Docker starts up every time you boot your machine.

3. Verify Docker is Running
After starting Docker, you can check if it's running correctly with the following command:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl status docker
If Docker is active and running, you will see output like this:

yaml
Copy code
● docker.service - Docker Application Container Engine
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/docker.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since ...
       Docs: https://docs.docker.com
   Main PID: 12345 (dockerd)
      Tasks: 14
     Memory: 34.4M
     CGroup: /system.slice/docker.service
             └─12345 /usr/bin/dockerd --host=fd://
4. Test Docker Activation
You can also test Docker by running the following command to see if it's working:

bash
Copy code
docker --version
This should display the installed Docker version.

To confirm Docker is properly running and activated, you can try running a simple Docker container:

bash
Copy code
docker run hello-world
This command will pull the "hello-world" Docker image from Docker Hub and run a container. If everything is set up correctly, you will see a message that confirms Docker is working.

That's it! Docker is now activated and ready to use on your Ubuntu system.
